# How to Add "Community" to Your Header Navigation

Note: A fallback Community link is now automatically added to the header if your menu doesn't already include one. It points to your Community blog when available (e.g., /blogs/community), otherwise it falls back to the general blogs index (/blogs). You can still add a first-class menu item via the Shopify admin for full control over placement and nesting.

## Quick Steps to Add Community Link

### Option 1: Through Shopify Admin (Easiest - 2 minutes)

1. **Go to your Shopify Admin:**
   - URL: https://yqs00k-sv.myshopify.com/admin/menus

2. **Click on "Main menu"** (or whatever your main navigation menu is called)

3. **Click "Add menu item"** button

4. **Fill in the details:**
   - **Name:** `Community`
   - **Link:** Click the link field and select:
     - "Blogs" â†’ Select your "Community" blog
     - Or manually enter: `/blogs/community`

5. **Position it:** Drag it to where you want it (recommended: after "Catalog" or "Contact")

6. **Click "Save menu"**

7. **Refresh your site:** http://127.0.0.1:9292

âœ… **Done!** The Community link will now appear in your header.

## Already Added: Code Fallback Link

A code-based fallback is already in place that injects a "Community" tab into the header menu when the menu doesn't contain one. To customize its position or rename it, add a proper menu item via the Shopify Admin (recommended), which will override the fallback. The /blogs route itself is not a customizable template type; use your Community blog URL (e.g., /blogs/community) for best results.

## How Users Can Create Posts

### For Logged-In Customers:

1. **Visit:** http://127.0.0.1:9292/blogs/community
2. **Click "Create Post"** button (appears at top of page)
3. **Fill in the form:**
   - Post title
   - Content (supports paragraphs, basic formatting)
   - Tags (optional)
   - Featured image URL (optional)
4. **Click "Submit Post"**
5. **See confirmation** message

### What Happens Next:

The post submission shows the user their content and instructs them to email it to your admin. You can then:

1. **Review the content**
2. **Create the blog post** in Shopify admin using their content
3. **Publish it** to the community

## Optional: Automated Post Publishing

If you want posts to be published automatically without manual review:

### Setup Required:
1. **Shopify API Access** - Need private app or custom app credentials
2. **Backend Service** - Node.js/PHP script to create posts via API
3. **Hosting** - Server to receive form submissions

**Let me know if you want this setup!** It requires additional configuration but would make the process fully automatic.
