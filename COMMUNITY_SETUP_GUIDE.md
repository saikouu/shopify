## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Blog page not styled
**Solution:** Refresh browser, clear cache, check that `community-steam-style.css` loaded

### Issue: No blog posts showing
**Solution:** Create at least one blog post in Shopify admin

### Issue: Navigation link not showing
**Solution:** Follow Step 1 above to add menu item through Shopify admin

### Issue: White text on white background
**Solution:** The CSS avoids this by using:
- Transparent/dark backgrounds (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03)`)
